Find 'em!

### Droid Finder (aka 'Mastermind')
* As an Imperial Stormtrooper, your task (of paramount importance) is to find a set of unique droids somewhere in the galaxy. These droids must also be presented to your Sith authority in a specific order. You'll have a few chances to guess the right droids, and to determine their unique order. Thankfully, you'll also have a few hints that aren't subject to Jedi obfuscation.

***Game Componentry***
  * Selectable Droids
  - Depending on the difficulty setting of the game, you'll have 4 - 8 droids to include in your guesses.
  * N-Droid "Code"
  - Depending on the difficulty setting of the game, you'll have either a 4- or 5-droid "code" to break.
  * Result Markers
  - After submission of each guess: A BLACK peg will be displayed to represent each correct droid in the correct position, a WHITE peg will be displayed to represent each correct droid in the wrong position, and a CIRCLED X will be displayed to represent each incorrect droid.
